## Getting Started

### Your First Project

**Conversation:**

```
You: "List my projects"

Claude: [Uses list_projects tool]
You currently have no projects. Would you like to create one?

You: "Yes, create a project called my_first_app"

Claude: [Uses create_project tool]
✅ Project created successfully!
- Name: my_first_app
- Original name: my_first_app

The project is now ready for use. What would you like to add to it?

You: "Show me the stats"

Claude: [Uses get_project_stats tool]
Project Statistics for my_first_app:
- Epics: 0
- Features: 0
- Tasks: 0
- Total Items: 0

The project is empty and ready for you to add epics, features, and tasks.
```

## Basic Workflow

### Creating a Complete Hierarchy

**Scenario:** Setting up a new authentication system

```
You: "Create an epic called User Authentication in my_first_app with status planning"

Claude: [Uses create_epic tool]
✅ Epic created!

Epic: "User Authentication"
ID: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
Status: planning
Description: (empty)

Would you like to add features to this epic?

You: "Yes, add a feature called Login System with UAT: Users can log in with email and password, and it should reference src/auth/login.ts"

Claude: [Uses create_feature tool with epicId: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011]
✅ Feature created!

Feature: "Login System"
ID: 507f191e810c19729de860ea
Parent Epic: User Authentication
UAT: Users can log in with email and password
Reference File: src/auth/login.ts
Status: todo

You: "Add these tasks to that feature:
     - Create login API endpoint
     - Add JWT token generation
     - Implement password hashing
     - Add rate limiting"

Claude: [Uses create_task tool 4 times with featureId: 507f191e810c19729de860ea]
✅ Created 4 tasks:

1. "Create login API endpoint" (507f1f77bcf86cd799439012)
2. "Add JWT token generation" (507f1f77bcf86cd799439013)
3. "Implement password hashing" (507f1f77bcf86cd799439014)
4. "Add rate limiting" (507f1f77bcf86cd799439015)

All tasks are set to "todo" status under the "Login System" feature.

You: "Show me the full tree"

Claude: [Uses get_project_tree tool]
📊 User Authentication (planning) - 0% complete
  └── ✨ Login System (todo) - 0% complete
      ├── ✅ Create login API endpoint (todo)
      ├── ✅ Add JWT token generation (todo)
      ├── ✅ Implement password hashing (todo)
      └── ✅ Add rate limiting (todo)

Progress: 0/4 tasks completed
```

---

### Completing Work (Auto-Status Updates)

**Scenario:** Marking tasks as done and watching the magic happen

```
You: "I finished the password hashing task. Mark it as done."

Claude: [Uses mark_task_done tool on task 507f1f77bcf86cd799439014]
✅ Task "Implement password hashing" marked as done!

Current Progress:
- Login System feature: 1/4 tasks complete (25%)
- User Authentication epic: 0/1 features complete (0%)

You: "Also done with JWT generation and the API endpoint"

Claude: [Uses mark_task_done tool twice]
✅ Marked as done:
- "Add JWT token generation"
- "Create login API endpoint"

Current Progress:
- Login System feature: 3/4 tasks complete (75%)
- User Authentication epic: 0/1 features complete (0%)

You: "And the rate limiting is done too"

Claude: [Uses mark_task_done tool]
✅ Task "Add rate limiting" marked as done!

🎉 AUTOMATIC UPDATES:
✅ All tasks in "Login System" are complete!
✅ Feature "Login System" automatically updated to "done"
✅ All features in "User Authentication" are complete!
✅ Epic "User Authentication" automatically updated to "done"

Final Status:
📊 User Authentication (done) - 100% complete
  └── ✨ Login System (done) - 100% complete
      ├── ✅ Create login API endpoint (done)
      ├── ✅ Add JWT token generation (done)
      ├── ✅ Implement password hashing (done)
      └── ✅ Add rate limiting (done)

Congratulations! The entire User Authentication epic is complete!

```
You: "Search all my projects for anything related to authentication"

You: First, list all my projects

Claude: [Uses list_projects]
Projects:
- my_first_app
- ecommerce_site

Task Details:
- Title: Add rate limiting
- Description: Prevent brute force attacks
- Status: todo
- UAT: Rate limiting blocks suspicious activity

You: "Delete this task from Login System"

✅ Task deleted

You: "Create the same task under OAuth Integration"

Claude: [Uses create_task]
✅ Task recreated under OAuth Integration feature!
- Title: Add rate limiting
- Description: Prevent brute force attacks
- Status: todo
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Use Natural Language

Claude understands context:
- ✅ "Add a feature for login"
- ✅ "Mark that task as done" (referring to previous)
- ✅ "Show me what's blocked"

### 2. Reference by Name or ID

- "Mark task 507f1f77bcf86cd799439012 as done" ← Using ID
- "Complete the JWT validation task" ← Using name

### 3. Batch Operations

Instead of one at a time:
```
"Create these tasks:
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3"
```

### 4. Use Tree View for Overview

Start conversations with:
```
"Show me the project tree"
```

Gets you oriented quickly!

### 5. Leverage Auto-Status

Just mark tasks done - parents update automatically!
